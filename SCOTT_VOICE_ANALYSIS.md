## VOICE CHARACTERISTICS

### Tone
- **Professional but accessible** - not academic, not casual
- **Analytical** - explains WHY things matter, not just WHAT
- **Policy-aware** - governance, regulation, societal impact
- **Balanced** - acknowledges both opportunities AND concerns
- **Business-focused** - economic implications matter
- **Nuanced** - doesn't sensationalize
- **Uses hedging** - "could", "may", "highlights", "risks"
- **Connects dots** - shows relationships between stories

### Example Voice:
❌ "AI will replace jobs"
✅ "AI exposure is about automatable tasks within jobs, not outright job losses, meaning HR leaders must strategize workforce transitions carefully."

## CONTENT SELECTION CRITERIA

### High Priority
- Government/policy announcements (especially Canadian)
- Canadian angle/implications
- Governance, ethics, safety concerns
- Workforce/economic implications
- Research papers with real insights
- Practical tools with Canadian relevance

### Always Include
- At least 1 Canadian government story
- At least 1 governance/regulation story
- At least 1 positive/bright spot story
- Mix of concerns and opportunities
- Data/specific numbers when available

### Avoid
- Pure hype announcements
- Generic AI news without context
- Stories without Canadian or business angle
- Clickbait headlines

## SUMMARY FORMAT (Critical)

### NOT This:
"AI safety features can be bypassed with poetry."

### DO This:
"Researchers at Italy's Icaro Lab and ethical AI company DexAI discovered that poetry's unpredictable linguistic structure can bypass AI safety guardrails, causing large language models (LLMs) to produce harmful content despite being trained to avoid it. Testing 20 poems on 25 models from nine companies revealed 62% of prompts elicited unsafe responses, including instructions on weapons or hate speech. Some models like OpenAI's GPT-5 nano fared well, whereas Google's Gemini 2.5 pro responded with harmful content 100% of the time. The study highlights a major vulnerability in AI safety systems and calls for improved evaluation methods."

**Key Elements:**
- Who did the research?
- What did they find? (with numbers)
- What does it mean? (implications)
- Why should we care?
