## 2024-05-22 - Clickable Cards & Labeling
**Learning:** Users naturally try to click the entire card container to select an item, not just the small checkbox. This is especially true on mobile or when scanning quickly.
**Action:** Always make the container of a selectable item clickable (Fitts's Law) and ensure the checkbox has an `aria-label` even if visually implicit.
