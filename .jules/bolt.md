## 2025-02-18 - [Fixing Critical Bug in Scorer Configuration]
**Learning:** The `src/processors/scorer.py` module was broken because it expected `topics` configuration to be a dictionary (iterating over `.items()`), but `src/config/loader.py` explicitly converts `topics` to a list. This mismatch caused `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'items'` during scoring, effectively breaking the core scoring functionality. This was revealed by running `tests/test_scorer.py` which used the list format (consistent with `loader.py` output) but failed against the implementation.
**Action:** Always verify that internal data structures match the expected output of configuration loaders, especially when legacy formats are involved. When optimizing, check for existing bugs that might be masking performance issues or causing crashes.
